#Fylo-dark-theme-landing-page
This is the first time I am building a project like this. 
This is my version of the static fylo dark theme page done with HTML & CSS.
My page needs a lot of work and edits because I am new to web development.
Most especially in the aspect of web responsiveness. 
How the page should look like is the file "desktop-design.jpg."
I hope I can improve my skills by practicing more and regularly.
I would love constructive criticism on my work and also improvement on my codes so I can learn more and better.
Please, edited codes should have comments so I can learn from them.
